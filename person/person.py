class Person:
    # Note: classes/methods take `self` as a first argument
    #       any additional arguments come after self in the __init__
    #       but `self` is automatically given when creating a new
    #       instance of the class.
    #
    #       ex:
    #         a Person class with def __init__(self, name)
    #         would be instantiated as: mark = Person("Mark")
    def __init__(self):
        pass # remove me to start building out the class
